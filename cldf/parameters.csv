A_Marking_Type,A Marking Type,None; differential; stable overt,A
A_Local_or_Global,A Local or Global,Only for differential and depending on the properties of the argument(s): local = the use or omission of the marker depends only on the properties of the argument itself; global = the use of the marker also or solely depends on the properties of the other argument.,A
A_Marking_Contrast,A Marking Contrast,"Only for differential: zero_nonzero = when differential marking in a given language is privative, i.e. there is zero expression vs. non-zero (audible) expression; marker_length = when the differential marking pertains to different markers rather than zero expression vs. non-zero expression; stem_length = when the case forms differ in stem length (e.g. as in Ik).",A
A_Split_or_Fluid,A Split or Fluid,"Only for differential: Whether marking is split, fluid, split-fluid. NotApplicable if there is no marking (none in Marking_Type). Marking is split when Marking_Probability is >90%/<10%, fluid when Marking_Probability is >50%, 50%, <50%, <, or >, and split-fluid when both split and fluid marking occurs in a given language.",A

A_Animacy_Scale,A Animacy Scale,"Whether marking in a language fits or violates the animacy hierarchy (Human > Animal > Inanimate) or not. Values: fit = fits; viol = violates; mixed (some parts of the scale are supported and some are violated); none (the scale is not relevant for DM). See Notes 1 and 2.

Note 1: Fitting a scale means that the shorter form(s) is used with high-prominence P and/or low-prominence A, while shorter form is used with low-prominence P and/or high-prominence A. It includes zero-nonzero marking, different marker lengths and different stem lengths (e.g. in Ik). Both global and local marking are considered.
Note 2: if there is a split in one category, such that the members of this category are either marked or unmarked, and the other categories are not split, this is still evaluated as fit or viol. See ybh_01 (split inside PRON, no split inside PROPER and NOUN).",A
A_Pronom_Scale,A Pronom Scale,"Whether marking in a language violates the pronominality hierarchy (Pron > Proper > Common Nouns) or not.
