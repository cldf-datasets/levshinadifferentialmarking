Usages	Example_ID	ID of the example in the Examples spreadsheet
Languages	Language	Name of the language
Languages	Marking_Type	None; differential; stable overt
Languages	Local_or_Global	Only for differential and depending on the properties of the argument(s): local = the use or omission of the marker depends only on the properties of the argument itself; global = the use of the marker also or solely depends on the properties of the other argument.
Languages	Marking_Contrast	Only for differential: zero_nonzero = when differential marking in a given language is privative, i.e. there is zero expression vs. non-zero (audible) expression; marker_length = when the differential marking pertains to different markers rather than zero expression vs. non-zero expression; stem_length = when the case forms differ in stem length (e.g. as in Ik).
Languages	Split_or_Fluid	Only for differential: Whether marking is split, fluid, split-fluid. NotApplicable if there is no marking (none in Marking_Type). Marking is split when Marking_Probability is >90%/<10%, fluid when Marking_Probability is >50%, 50%, <50%, <, or >, and split-fluid when both split and fluid marking occurs in a given language.
Languages	TAM_DM	Does marking depend on TAM_Conditions? Values: yes; no.
Languages	WO_DM	Does marking depend on WordOrder_Conditions? Values: yes; no.
Languages	Other_DM	Does marking depend on Other_Conditions? Values: yes; no.
Languages	Animacy_Scale	Whether marking in a language fits or violates the animacy hierarchy (Human > Animal > Inanimate) or not. Values: fit = fits; viol = violates; mixed (some parts of the scale are supported and some are violated); none (the scale is not relevant for DM). See Notes 1 and 2.
Languages	Pronom_Scale	Whether marking in a language violates the pronominality hierarchy (Pron > Proper > Common Nouns) or not. Values: fit = fits; viol = violates; mixed (some parts of the scale are supported and some are violated); none (the scale is not relevant for DM). See Notes 1 and 2.
Languages	Def_Scale	Whether marking in a language violates the definiteness hierarchy (Definite > Specific > Non-Specific) or not. Values: fit = fits; viol = violates; mixed (some parts of the scale are supported and some are violated); none (the scale is not relevant for DM). See Notes 1 and 2.
Languages	Person_Scale	Whether marking in a language violates the person hierarchy (Speech-act participants (1 + 2) > 3) or not. Values: fit = fits; viol = violates; mixed (some parts of the scale are supported and some are violated); none (the scale is not relevant for DM). See Notes 1 and 2.

#Notes		
Note 1: Fitting a scale means that the shorter form(s) is used with high-prominence P and/or low-prominence A, while shorter form is used with low-prominence P and/or high-prominence A. It includes zero-nonzero marking, different marker lengths and different stem lengths (e.g. in Ik). Both global and local marking are considered.		
Note 2: if there is a split in one category, such that the members of this category are either marked or unmarked, and the other categories are not split, this is still evaluated as fit or viol. See ybh_01 (split inside PRON, no split inside PROPER and NOUN).
